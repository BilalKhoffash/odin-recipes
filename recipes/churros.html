        <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
        <h3>Churros are ridged sticks of deep-fried choux pastry dough coated in cinnamon sugar. They're a popular type of donut across Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin American cuisines. While unfilled, cinnamon sugar-coated churros are the most popular variety, churros' shape, filling, and dipping sauce vary by the culture that creates them. Churros are easy and inexpensive to make and offer a global allure built on a universally beloved foundation: sweet, fried dough.</h3>
        <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2.5 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>
            <li>0.5 cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><u>Step by step guide:</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, 2.5 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball.</li>
            <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Carefully pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil; work in batches so you don't crowd the fryer. Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer churros to paper towels to drain.</li>
            <li>Combine 0.5 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture.</li>
