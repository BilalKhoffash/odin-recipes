        <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
        <h3>Churros are ridged sticks of deep-fried choux pastry dough coated in cinnamon sugar. They're a popular type of donut across Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin American cuisines. While unfilled, cinnamon sugar-coated churros are the most popular variety, churros' shape, filling, and dipping sauce vary by the culture that creates them. Churros are easy and inexpensive to make and offer a global allure built on a universally beloved foundation: sweet, fried dough.</h3>
