        <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (100 grams) pasta (penne or macaroni)</li>
            <li>1.5 cup milk (full fat or plant milk)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter + 0.5 tablespoon oil or butter (to sauté veggies)</li>
            <li>0.25 cup heavy cream or 2 to 3 tablespoons cheese (optional, parmesan, cream cheese, mozzarella or cheddar)</li>
            <li>1.5 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>0.25 teaspoon black pepper (crushed or ground, adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves grated (optional, can use 1 teaspoon to tablespoon as per preference)</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon oregano (or dried mix Italian herbs)</li>
            <li>salt as needed</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon red chili flakes (optional, adjust to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><u>Step by step guide:</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring 4 cups of water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add pasta and 0.25 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Cook on a medium high flame till al dente. Check the instructions on the pasta package for the correct cook time. Check them a minute earlier than mentioned on the package. They must be tender, firm and chewy but not mushy. Mine takes about 9 mins.</li>
            <li>Reserve about 0.25 cup pasta cooked stock.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta to a colander. Cover and keep aside.</li>
            <li>Pour 0.5 tbsp oil or butter to a pan. Add the vegetables and sauté them on a medium high heat until slightly tender yet crunchy. This takes me about 5 to 6 mins. Remove to a plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter and add minced garlic (optional) and fry for 30 to 40 seconds on a medium heat.</li>
            <li>Stir in all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Saute well until the flour loses the raw smell, for about a minute. Don't brown the flour. Since this is a small quantity, the roux can become dry and clumpy. It's just fine. Turn off the stove/heat and slowly pour 0.5 cup milk while you stir to incorporate the milk into the roux. </li>
            <li>Keep whisking till it looks creamy & uniform to prevent forming lumps. Pour the rest of the milk and stir well.</li>
            <li>Turn on the heat and cook on a medium-low until the white sauce becomes thick. Keep stirring/whisking & scrape the sides for a uniform sauce through out.</li>
            <li>Pour the heavy cream or cheese and mix well.</li>
            <li>The white sauce is done perfectly when it is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. Alternately you can draw a finger/line through the coated spoon. The sauce should wipe clean and leave a space, meaning it is thick enough.</li>
            <li>Add the vegetables and the cooked pasta & mix well.</li>
            <li>Add pepper, oregano (or mixed Italian herbs) and chili flakes. You can also add a pinch of ground nutmeg if you want. If the sauce looks too thick (as it cools down), add 2 tbsps of the reserved stock so the sauce loosens a bit.</li>
            <li>Garnish white sauce pasta with red chilli flakes and crushed black pepper. Serve it hot or warm as the sauce thickens more when it cools down.</li>
        </ol>
